# OMEGA-1.2
This is a Custom Rp2040 Chip Based MicroPad , It has 9 Switches , a roter encode and a oled screen . We used matrix for switches so it uses less gpio pins and it has 4 layers the rotor key is used to change the layers which is displaced on the screen so in total we have  keys output 9x4=36 + 4 outputs from rotor = 40 Outputs.
